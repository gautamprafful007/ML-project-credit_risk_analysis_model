<h1>📊 Credit Risk Analysis Model</h1>
An end‑to‑end machine learning solution that evaluates the probability of default (credit risk) for borrowers using financial profiles and transactional data.

<h2>🚀 Project Overview</h2>
The goal is to predict a borrower’s likelihood of defaulting on a loan. The repository includes:

Data preprocessing pipelines

Feature engineering and resampling to manage class imbalance

Training and evaluating multiple ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Model interpretation tools (e.g. SHAP, LIME)

Optional deployment-ready modules (e.g. API service or simple interface)

<h2>🔧 Setup & Installation</h2>
<h3>Clone the repo</h3>

bash<br>
Copy<br>
Edit<br>
git clone https://github.com/gautamprafful007/ML-project-credit_risk_analysis_model.git<br>
cd ML-project-credit_risk_analysis_model<br>

<h3>Install dependencies</h3>

bash<br>
Copy<br>
Edit<br>
pip install -r requirements.txt<br>
Prepare data<br>

Place raw data in data/raw/<br>

Run preprocessing script or notebook to generate data/processed/

<h2>🧠 Data Workflow</h2>

<li>Data Exploration</li>
Perform EDA to understand distributions, missing values, and default rate imbalance.

Visualize feature-target relationships to inform preprocessing choices.

<li>Preprocessing & Feature Engineering</li>
Handle missing values and categorical encoding (e.g. one-hot, label encoding).

Manage class imbalance (default is typically <10%) using SMOTE, under-/over-sampling.

Feature scaling or transformation if needed (e.g. standardization, log transforms).

<li>Model Training & Evaluation</li>
Models evaluated may include: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM.

Use cross-validation and metrics like ROC‑AUC, precision, recall, F1‑score.

Compare candidate models and choose the best based on performance and business criteria.

<h2>🧪 Usage & Example</h2>
From the Notebook
Open train_credit_risk.ipynb to run through EDA, model training, evaluation, and interpretability.

From CLI or API
python
Copy
Edit
from src.predict_api import predict

profile = {
  "credit_limit": 5000,
  "num_of_loans": 1,
  "debt_to_income": 0.25,
  "...": "other relevant features"
}

score, risk = predict(profile)
print(f"Default probability: {score:.2f}, Risk label: {risk}")

<h2>📊 Results & Insights</h2>
Model performance typically yields high AUC (≈ 0.95–0.98), with strong class separation.

Top predictors often include variables like credit utilization, prior defaults, income stability, or debt-to-income ratios.

Interpretability plots help stakeholders understand model decisions.

<h2>⚙️ Best Practices & Precautions</h2>
No data leakage: Always fit preprocessing (e.g. encoders, scalers) on training data, then apply transform on test data only.

Robust validation: Use stratified cross-validation; ensure resampling is nested within cross‑validation folds.

Explainability matters: Financial decisions must be transparent—include SHAP/LIME explanations in reporting.

<h2>📈 Future Enhancements</h2>
Add time-series awareness (e.g. historical credit score trajectories).

Deploy real-time API using Streamlit or Flask.

Incorporate macroeconomic indicators to adjust the probability of default over time (point‑in‑time/default cycle).

Schedule model retraining, monitor concept drift, and update to satisfy regulatory needs.

<h2>🧾 Dependencies</h2>
See requirements.txt for precise library versions. Common dependencies:

pandas, numpy

scikit-learn, xgboost, imblearn (for SMOTE)

matplotlib, seaborn

shap, lime

<h2>✅ Summary</h2>
This project provides a comprehensive and modular approach to credit risk modeling—from data cleanup to predictive scoring and explainable outcomes. It’s well-suited for real-world deployment in fintech, banking, or any domain requiring assessment of borrower reliability.
